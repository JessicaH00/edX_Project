            <h3>Ingredients</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>10 - 12 vanilla Oreo cookies</li>
                <li>2 tbsp of melted butter</li>
                <li>100 grams of cream cheese at room temperature</li>
                <li>3 tbsp of confectioners sugar</li>
                <li>¼ tsp of vanilla extract</li>
                <li>250 ml of whipping cream, chilled</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Instructions</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>Add 8 Oreo cookies to a mixing bowl. Using the tip of a meat tenderizer or the tool of your choice, break them up so they resemble dry, crumbly sand. Add in 2 tbsp of melted butter. Mix it together until it resembles a wet sand. Add it to the bottom of a spring form pan and pack it down gently using a spatula.</li>
                <li>Add the whipping cream to a mixing bowl. Using a whisk or electric mixer, beat it until it doubles in volume and peaks form. This should take about 3 to 5 minutes. Set it aside in the fridge or in a cool place. Make sure the whipping cream is chilled before using it.</li>
                <li>Put the cream cheese in another mixing bowl. Add in the confectioners sugar and the vanilla extract. Mix until it's well combined and creamy. Add the whipped cream to the cream cheese mixture and beat it together.</li>
                <li>Break up the other 2 Oreo cookies into tiny bits and fold them into the mixture.</li>
                <li>Add the cream cheese mixture into the spring form pan so it comes to the top. Smooth it out with a spatula and top it with bits of Oreo cookies.</li>
                <li>Place it in the fridge and chill until it's set. This should take 5 to 6 hours but overnight is preferred. You can also set it aside in the freezer to have an ice cream consistency. 
                <li>Serve and enjoy your no bake Oreo cheesecake.</li>

            <h3>Ingredients</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>1½ cups of water</li>
                <li>1 cup of mango juice</li>
                <li>½ cup of milk</li>
                <li>15 grams of unflavoured jelly powder</li>
                <li>¼ cup of sugar</li>
                <li>1 cup of table cream or all purpose cream</li>
                <li>300 ml of sweetened condensed milk</li>
                <li>1 cup of cooked tapioca pearls</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Instructions</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>In a medium size pot or saucepan, combine the water, mango juice, milk, jelly powder, and sugar.</li>
                <li>Bring it to a boil, over high heat, and stir until well incorporated. Let it cool for 3-4 minutes.</li>
                <li>Pour it into the container of your choice. It should be fairly flat and wide as you'll have to slice the jelly when it's set. Allow it to set, in the fridge, for at least an hour.</li>
                <li>In a smaller pot, boil some water and cook the tapioca pearls until translucent and tender. This should take about 45 minutes or so. Drain and set them aside.</li>
                <li>AWhen the jelly is set, remove it from the fridge, and cut it into bite size chunks.</li>
                <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the jelly chunks, table cream, condensed milk, and tapioca pearls. Mix until well incorporated.
                <li>Set it aside in the fridge to chill for at least two hours.</li>
                <li>Serve and enjoy your mango jelly.</li>
